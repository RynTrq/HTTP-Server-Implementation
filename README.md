I developed a multi-threaded HTTP server implementation in Python to explore core networking concepts and socket programming. This project demonstrates the evolution from a basic single-threaded server to a more robust multi-threaded solution.
Key Features

Custom HTTP server implementation using Python's socket programming
Client-server architecture with proper request-response handling
Support for basic HTTP GET requests
Multi-threaded server capability for handling concurrent client connections
Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 404, 410, 500)
Clean separation between client and server components

Technical Implementation
The project consists of three main components:

A client application that can request files from the server
A single-threaded server implementation (part_1)
An enhanced multi-threaded version (part_2) that can handle multiple client requests simultaneously

The server implementations include proper HTTP response formatting, file handling, and error management. I used Python's threading module to handle concurrent connections, making the server more scalable and responsive under multiple client requests.
Learning Outcomes
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

Socket programming in Python
HTTP protocol implementation
Multi-threading concepts
Error handling in networked applications
Client-server architecture patterns
